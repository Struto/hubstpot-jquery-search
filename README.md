# hubstpot-jquery-search
A beta version of HubSpot search powered by jQuery


## What does it do?
Basically searches your HubSpot portal blog post by title from the listing page (blog/all) and displays then in the (/blog) on top of your blog list. 


## Current Issues
Current issues are mainly on user experience. The scripts makes the content jump all over the place when searching on small screen. 


## What do I have in mind?
@Archie22is (https://github.com/Archie22is) thinks waiting to hit the enter key and displaying the results in a lightbox or using a similar jQuery library will solve the problem. 


## Version 
- Beta
- Wait for more awesome commit or feel free to enhance the script
